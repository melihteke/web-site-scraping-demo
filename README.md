# web-site-scraping-demo
This repository contains a Python script for automating the login process to the CloudTalk website using Selenium WebDriver. It demonstrates how to programmatically navigate to the login page, enter credentials, submit the login form, and then capture and print the resulting webpage's HTML content. 

Additionally, it showcases the use of BeautifulSoup for parsing and prettifying the HTML content of the page after login. This script serves as a practical example of web automation and scraping techniques combining Selenium for browser automation and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.
